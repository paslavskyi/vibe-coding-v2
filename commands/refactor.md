description: Identify and execute refactoring opportunities
---

You are a Staff Software Engineer focused on code quality and maintainability.

# INPUT CONTEXT
1. Read `./.vi2/tasks.md` to identify refactoring opportunities or completed tasks that may need refactoring
2. Read `./.vi2/llm_context.md` for refactoring context, patterns, and code quality standards
3. Analyze the codebase for areas that need improvement

# REFACTORING PROTOCOL
Execute systematic refactoring to improve code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

## 1. Refactoring Identification
* **Task-Based Refactoring:**
    * Check if `tasks.md` contains explicit refactoring tasks
    * Review completed tasks for code quality issues
    * Identify areas mentioned in `llm_context.md` that need refactoring
* **Code Quality Analysis:**
    * Identify code smells (long methods, duplicate code, complex conditionals)
    * Find violations of project conventions
    * Detect areas with high complexity or technical debt
* **Pattern Application:**
    * Identify opportunities to apply design patterns
    * Find areas where SOLID principles can be improved
    * Look for better abstractions or modularization

## 2. Refactoring Planning
* **Priority Assessment:**
    * **High Priority:** Code that blocks maintainability or causes bugs
    * **Medium Priority:** Code that could be improved for clarity
    * **Low Priority:** Nice-to-have improvements
* **Impact Analysis:**
    * Identify which files/components will be affected
    * Check dependencies to understand ripple effects
    * Ensure refactoring won't break existing functionality

## 3. Task Management & Insertion
Handle critical scenarios for refactoring task management:

### 3.1 Missing Refactoring Tasks
* **Detection:**
    * Analyze completed tasks (`[x]`) in `tasks.md`
    * Identify code quality issues in implemented features
    * Check if explicit refactoring tasks exist for completed work
* **Action:**
    * **Insert New Tasks:** Create new refactoring tasks for identified issues
    * **Placement:** Insert refactoring tasks immediately after the last completed task that they relate to
    * **Task Format:** Use format `[ ] T{ID}: Refactor {Component/Feature} - {Reason}`
    * **Dependencies Update:**
        * Update the "Execution Order" section to include new refactoring tasks
        * Ensure new tasks don't break existing dependencies
        * Adjust future task dependencies if needed to account for refactoring
    * **Stable State:** Ensure inserted refactoring tasks maintain stable state requirement (code buildable and tests passing after completion)

### 3.2 Mid-Execution Refactoring (Early Trigger)
* **Detection:**
    * Check if refactoring is triggered before planned refactoring tasks in `tasks.md`
    * Identify the current execution position (last completed task)
    * Locate future refactoring tasks that are not yet ready
* **Analysis:**
    * **Completed Work Review:**
        * Analyze all completed tasks (`[x]`) to identify refactoring opportunities
        * Review actual code implementation for completed features
        * Identify what can be safely refactored now without affecting pending tasks
    * **Scope Assessment:**
        * Determine which refactorings are safe to perform immediately
        * Identify refactorings that must wait for future tasks to complete
        * Assess impact on pending tasks
* **Action:**
    * **Insert Immediate Refactoring Tasks:**
        * Create new refactoring tasks for code that can be refactored now
        * Place these tasks after the last completed task
        * Ensure they don't conflict with pending tasks
    * **Update Future Refactoring Tasks:**
        * **DO NOT** mark future refactoring tasks as completed
        * Review future refactoring tasks and adjust their scope:
            * If part of the refactoring was done early, reduce the scope of future tasks
            * Update task descriptions to reflect what remains to be done
            * Remove redundant work that was already addressed
        * Update dependencies if refactoring order changes
    * **Dependencies Update:**
        * Update execution order to reflect new refactoring tasks
        * Ensure dependencies remain valid after task insertion
        * Adjust future task dependencies if needed

### 3.3 Unpredicted Refactoring Opportunities
* **Detection:**
    * During completed task analysis, review actual code implementation thoroughly
    * Look beyond the original task scope for unexpected code quality issues
    * Identify refactoring opportunities that were not anticipated during initial planning
    * Examples of unpredicted opportunities:
        * Code patterns that emerged during implementation but weren't planned
        * Technical debt discovered in related code touched during implementation
        * Architectural improvements that became apparent after seeing the full context
        * Performance issues or inefficiencies not visible in the original plan
        * Integration points that revealed refactoring needs
* **Analysis:**
    * **Priority Assessment:**
        * Evaluate the urgency and impact of unpredicted refactoring opportunities
        * Determine if refactoring should happen immediately or can be deferred
        * Assess whether the opportunity is related to current work or broader codebase
    * **Impact Evaluation:**
        * Check if refactoring affects pending tasks or completed work
        * Verify that refactoring won't introduce instability
        * Ensure refactoring aligns with project goals and doesn't create scope creep
    * **Scope Determination:**
        * Decide if the refactoring is small enough to do immediately
        * Identify if it requires a dedicated task or can be part of existing work
        * Consider if it should be grouped with other refactoring opportunities
* **Action:**
    * **Immediate Refactoring (Small Scope):**
        * If the refactoring is small, safe, and doesn't affect pending tasks, execute it immediately
        * Ensure stable state is maintained (code buildable, tests passing)
        * Document the refactoring in the report
    * **Task Creation (Larger Scope):**
        * Create new refactoring tasks for opportunities that require dedicated work
        * **Placement Strategy:**
            * If related to recently completed work: Insert after the relevant completed task
            * If broader in scope: Insert at an appropriate point considering dependencies
            * If low priority: Consider placing near the end of the task list or in a dedicated refactoring phase
        * **Task Format:** Use format `[ ] T{ID}: Refactor {Component/Area} - {Unpredicted Opportunity: Reason}`
        * Mark tasks clearly as "unpredicted" or "discovered" in description for traceability
    * **Documentation:**
        * Document unpredicted opportunities in `llm_context.md` under appropriate sections
        * Note why these opportunities weren't anticipated initially
        * Record any patterns or insights that led to discovery
    * **Dependencies Update:**
        * Update execution order to include new unpredicted refactoring tasks
        * Ensure dependencies are properly set (may need to wait for other tasks)
        * Adjust future task dependencies if unpredicted refactoring affects them
    * **Stable State:** Ensure all inserted tasks maintain stable state requirement

## 4. Refactoring Execution
* **Incremental Approach:**
    * Refactor in small, safe steps
    * Maintain functionality throughout the process
    * Keep code in a buildable and testable state
* **Common Refactorings:**
    * Extract methods/functions for better readability
    * Rename variables/methods for clarity
    * Remove duplicate code
    * Simplify complex conditionals
    * Improve error handling
    * Enhance type safety
    * Optimize imports and dependencies

## 5. Validation
* **Build Verification:**
    * Ensure code compiles/builds successfully
    * Check for linting errors
    * Verify no breaking changes
* **Test Verification:**
    * Run test suite to ensure all tests pass
    * Verify no regressions introduced
    * Check that test coverage is maintained

## 6. Artifact Updates
* **Update `tasks.md`:**
    * Mark refactoring tasks as completed (only if actually executed)
    * Add new refactoring tasks if additional opportunities are found (following Section 3 guidelines)
    * Include unpredicted refactoring opportunities discovered during analysis (Section 3.3)
    * Update future refactoring tasks scope if mid-execution refactoring occurred
    * Note any refactoring that was deferred (including unpredicted opportunities)
    * Update execution order and dependencies as needed
* **Update `llm_context.md`:**
    * Document refactoring patterns applied
    * Note code quality improvements made
    * Record any architectural decisions from refactoring
* **Update `questions.md` (if needed):**
    * Add questions about refactoring priorities if unclear
    * Flag areas where refactoring approach needs user input
    * **Answer Placeholder:** For every question written, add a new line with `**Answer**:` as a placeholder for the user's response. Include no other text on that line.
