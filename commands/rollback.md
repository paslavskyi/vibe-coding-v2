description: Revert completed tasks to a previous stable state

You are a Staff Software Engineer managing task rollback operations.

# INPUT CONTEXT
1. Read `./.vi2/tasks.md` to understand task completion status
2. Read `./.vi2/llm_context.md` for context about completed tasks
3. User may provide a specific task ID to rollback to, or no context (rollback to latest)

# ROLLBACK PROTOCOL
Revert completed tasks to restore the project to a previous stable state.

## 1. Rollback Target Determination
* **If User Provides Task ID:**
    * Target the specified task ID as the rollback point
    * Verify the task exists and is marked as completed (`[x]`)
    * This becomes the target state (this task and all before it remain completed)
* **If No Context Provided:**
    * Identify the most recently completed task (latest implemented task)
    * Identify the task immediately before it (the previous completed task)
    * The previous task becomes the target state (rollback to the previous task)
    * Rollback the latest task and everything after it

## 2. Task Identification for Rollback
* **Reverse Order Processing:**
    * Start from the latest completed task
    * Work backwards through completed tasks
    * Stop when reaching the target task (exclusive - target task remains completed, everything after it is rolled back)
    * **Note:** When no context is provided, the latest task is always included in the rollback
* **Task List:**
    * List all tasks that will be rolled back
    * Identify dependencies that will be affected
    * Note any tasks that depend on rolled-back tasks
    * If no context provided, the latest completed task is always included in the rollback

## 3. Code Reversion
* **File Changes:**
    * Identify files that were modified/created for rolled-back tasks
    * Revert code changes related to these tasks
    * Delete files that were created for these tasks
* **Dependency Cleanup:**
    * Remove imports that are no longer needed
    * Clean up dependencies added for rolled-back features
    * Restore previous implementations if overwritten

## 4. Artifact Updates
* **Update `tasks.md`:**
    * Change rolled-back tasks from `[x]` back to `[ ]`
    * Maintain task history (don't delete tasks)
    * Update execution order if needed
    * Note which tasks were rolled back and why
* **Update `llm_context.md`:**
    * Remove or update sections related to rolled-back features
    * Restore previous technical decisions if changed
    * Document the rollback reason
* **Update `questions.md` (if needed):**
    * Add questions about rollback if user input is needed
    * Note any blockers discovered during rollback
    * **Answer Placeholder:** For every question written, add a new line with `**Answer**:` as a placeholder for the user's response. Include no other text on that line.

## 5. Validation
* **Build Verification:**
    * Ensure code compiles/builds after rollback
    * Check for broken references or imports
    * Verify no compilation errors
* **Test Verification:**
    * Run test suite to ensure tests pass
    * Remove or update tests related to rolled-back features
    * Verify no test failures from rollback

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
Generate a rollback report with the following structure:

## Rollback Summary
* **Target Task:** T{ID} that remains completed
* **Tasks Rolled Back:** Count and list of task IDs
* **Status:** `SUCCESS` | `PARTIAL` | `FAILED`

## Rollback Details
* **Tasks Reverted:**
    * List each task ID rolled back
    * Brief description of what was reverted
* **Files Affected:**
    * Files modified
    * Files deleted
    * Files restored

## Validation Results
* **Build Status:** `PASS` | `FAIL`
* **Test Status:** `PASS` | `FAIL`
* **Issues Found:** Any problems encountered during rollback

## Next Steps
* **Recommendations:** What to do next
* **Blockers:** Any issues that prevent full rollback

# EXECUTION INSTRUCTION
Execute rollback in reverse order (latest to target). Ensure code is in a stable, buildable state after rollback. Update all artifacts to reflect the rollback operation.
