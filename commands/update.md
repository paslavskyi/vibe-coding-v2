description: Integrate new requirements into the existing vi2 plan

You are a Staff Software Engineer.

# INPUT CONTEXT
1.  **New Requirements:** Analyze the new requests/specs provided in the chat context (via @ files or text).
2.  **Current State:** Read `./.vi2/tasks.md` and `./.vi2/llm_context.md` to understand what has already been planned and what has been completed.

# PHASE 1: GAP ANALYSIS & RESEARCH
**Goal:** Integrate new requirements into the existing workflow without breaking history.

1.  **Research (If needed):**
    * If the new requirements contain Web Links or reference new Code Paths, perform the mandatory investigation immediately (same protocol as `/vi2/plan`).
    * **Cache Knowledge:** Prepare updates for `llm_context.md` based on this new research.

2.  **Backlog Reconciliation:**
    * Compare the **New Requirements** against the **Pending Tasks** (marked `[ ]`) in `tasks.md`.
    * Identify which pending tasks need to be modified, deleted, or if new tasks need to be inserted.
    * **Impact Analysis:** Assess how new requirements affect existing pending tasks.
        * Which tasks become obsolete?
        * Which tasks need modification?
        * What new dependencies are created?
    * **Risk Assessment:** Identify potential risks from the changes.
        * Breaking changes to completed work?
        * Complex integration points?
        * Timeline or scope impacts?

# PHASE 2: ARTIFACT UPDATES
Update the files in `./.vi2/` adhering to the following constraints:

## 1. `llm_context.md` (Knowledge Merge)
* **Append/Merge:** Add the new findings to the existing sections.
* **Conflict Resolution:** If new requirements contradict previous decisions (e.g., "Switch DB from SQLite to Postgres"), explicitly update the `# Technical Decisions` section and note the change reason.

## 2. `tasks.md` (Surgical Update)
* **IMMUTABLE RULE:** **NEVER** modify or delete tasks marked as completed (`[x]`). History must be preserved exactly as is.
* **Stable State Planning:**
    * **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Every task must lead to a stable state after completion.
    * **Task Granularity:** Plan tasks so that after implementing any task, the code should be:
        * Buildable (compiles without errors)
        * Testable (tests pass or at minimum no new failures)
    * **Task Grouping:** If needed, combine smaller related tasks into a single task to ensure stable state is achievable.
    * **Incremental Stability:** Each task should build upon a stable foundation from previous tasks.
* **Backlog Management:**
    * **Insert:** Add new tasks `[ ]` where they logically fit in the remaining flow. Assign unique IDs (e.g., continue the numbering or use `T-New-01` if strict ordering is hard).
    * **Modify:** If a pending task `[ ]` is now outdated, update its description to ensure stable state requirement.
    * **Delete:** If a pending task `[ ]` is no longer needed, remove it.
    * **Task Review:** Review all tasks to ensure they can achieve stable state upon completion.
* **Dependencies:** Update the "Execution Order" section to reflect how the new tasks fit into the remaining pipeline while maintaining stable state progression.

## 3. `questions.md` (Blockers)
* Create or Update this file only if the *New Requirements* introduce new ambiguities or missing resources.
* Follow the standard format: List Variants -> Provide Recommendation.
* **Impact Questions:** If the new requirements create significant impact or risks, add questions to clarify approach.
* **Answer Placeholder:** For every question written, add a new line with `**Answer**:` as a placeholder for the user's response. Include no other text on that line.

# EXECUTION INSTRUCTION
Perform the analysis of the new requirements against the existing plan. Then, surgically update the files in `./.vi2/` while protecting completed work.
