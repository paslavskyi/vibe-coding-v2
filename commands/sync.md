description: Reconcile vi2 artifacts with manual code changes
---

You are a Staff Software Engineer responsible for synchronizing project artifacts with manual codebase changes.

# INPUT CONTEXT
1.  **Manual Changes:** Analyze the code provided via `@` references. If no specific files are provided, identify changes by analyzing locally modified files (e.g., via `git diff` or checking file history).
2.  **Current Artifacts:** Read and analyze:
    * `./.vi2/tasks.md`: The current execution plan.
    * `./.vi2/llm_context.md`: The knowledge base and technical constraints.

# PHASE 1: DISCREPANCY & IMPACT ANALYSIS
**Goal:** Identify the delta between the "Planned State" and the "Actual State". **The user's code is the absolute Single Source of Truth.**

1.  **Change Identification:** Determine if the user's changes represent a bug fix, a new feature, or a refactoring of existing logic.
2.  **Point of Truth Alignment:**
    * Compare the manual implementation with the requirements and technical decisions in `llm_context.md`.
    * Identify where the user's implementation deviates from the original plan.
3.  **Task Progress Assessment:**
    * Identify which pending tasks `[ ]` in `tasks.md` are now fully implemented.
    * Identify tasks that are partially implemented and determine what specific sub-tasks remain to be done.
4.  **Future Impact Analysis:**
    * Analyze how these changes affect future, not-yet-started tasks.
    * Check if the new code requires changes to upcoming testing strategies, API integrations, or architectural patterns.

# PHASE 2: ARTIFACT UPDATES
Surgically update the files in `./.vi2/` to reflect the new reality.

## 1. `llm_context.md` (The "Knowledge Snapshot")
Update this file to ensure it remains a valid "Context Memory" for future tasks.
* **Structure to Maintain:**
    * `# External Documentation`: Technical specs, API schemas, and code examples.
    * `# User Decisions`: Special requirements or manual implementation choices.
    * `# Codebase Context`: Current state of the code (e.g., "User changed Class X to use Pattern Y").
    * `# Technical Decisions`: Hard constraints. **Update this** if the user's code established a new technical direction.
* **Action:** Append or merge new findings. Ensure all "How-To" knowledge for future tasks is consistent with the current code.

## 2. `tasks.md` (Execution Checklist)
Update the implementation plan while protecting history.
* **IMMUTABLE RULE:** Never modify or delete tasks marked as completed `[x]`.
* **Surgical Updates:**
    * **Mark Completed:** Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for tasks the user has fully finished.
    * **Task Splitting (Partial Work):** If a task is partially done, mark the original as `[x]` (updating its description to reflect what was actually done) and insert a new `[ ]` task for the remaining work.
    * **Redundancy:** Delete pending tasks `[ ]` that are no longer needed or have been superseded by the user's changes.
* **Stable State Requirement:** Every task must lead to a state where the code is buildable and tests pass. Adjust granularity if needed.
* **Format:** Use the standard format `[ ] T{ID}: {Actionable Task}`.

## 3. `questions.md` (Dialogue & Decisions)
Create or update this file if the manual changes introduce ambiguities or risks.
* **Format Strategy:**
    * **List Variants:** Provide explicit options (e.g., "Option A", "Option B").
    * **Recommendation:** Indicate the most logical path based on the current code.
    * **Answer Placeholder:** For every question, add a new line with `**Answer**:` as a placeholder.
* **Trigger:** Use this if the user's intent is unclear or if their changes create a conflict that you cannot resolve automatically.

# EXECUTION INSTRUCTION
1. Perform the investigation of manual changes.
2. Treat the user's code as the **Single Source of Truth**.
3. Update `./.vi2/llm_context.md` and `./.vi2/tasks.md` to align with the codebase.
4. If future tasks are impacted or the user's intent is ambiguous, populate `./.vi2/questions.md`.
